Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

---------------------------------------------------------
The solution of the project includes the following files:
---------------------------------------------------------

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R': Code for performing the analysis.

- 'tidy_data.txt': Tidy data set file created by running run_analysis.R

- 'code_book.txt': Code book describing the variables in the tidy data set.


--------------
run_analysis.R
--------------

To run the analysis code, the packages "dplyr" and "reshape2" have to be installed first. The code is written in the order of 5 steps described in the project instruction. Comments are added for easy code reading. The function writes the final tidy data set to a text file. The tidy data set is also the return value of the function.
